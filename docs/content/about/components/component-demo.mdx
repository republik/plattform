# Component Demo

With the Component Demo, you can include any JSX/TSX file in an MDX page, render it and also display its source code.

## Example

This is how it looks:

import { ComponentDemo } from '@/components'

{/* <ComponentDemo file='lib/examples/component-demo-example.tsx' /> */}

## Usage

```mdx filename="MDX"
import { ComponentDemo } from '@/components'

<ComponentDemo file='demos/my-demo.tsx' />
```

Where `demos/my-demo.tsx` needs to be located in the docs directory
