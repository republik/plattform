### Content Ideas

#### Design

- «Art Direction» for Product, not just Magazine
  - We do this in-house, find & build competence in tech team
- Design System: visually and written documentation but also as code
  - Spacing
  - Colors
  - Type
  - Layout
  - Fluid vs. responsive
  - Animation
- Accessibility built-in
  - Contrast
  - Font sizes
- Practice, Testing, Tools

#### Tech

- Accessibility built-in
  - Semantics first
  - CSS
  - Keyboard navigation
  - As little JS as needed (”progressive enhancement”)
  - ARIA if necessary
  - Alternative content (image alt text etc.)
- Inclusive Design > Accessibility
  - Perspectives, not disabilities
- Build for preference
  - Light/dark mode
  - High contrast?
- Performance
  - Ship less JS
  - Compress images
  - Resist adding complexity just because it's easy to do
- UI Language, wording, copy
- Practices, Testing, Tools
- UI Component catalog (Documentation & Code)
