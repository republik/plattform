A `<Collapsable />` wraps content that should be collapsed by default and can be expanded on click.

Supported props:
- `height`: Object defining `mobile` and `desktop` pixel height in collapsed state (defaults to `{mobile: 180, desktop: 240}`).
- `initialVisibility`: `preview`, `full` or `auto` (default, collapses if height + threshold is exceeded)
- `threshold`: We won't collapse a comment if it just slightly exceeds the heights above. This threshold can be adjusted in pixels (defaults to 50).
- `style`: An optional style object.
- `editorPreview`: only mark the cut off area visually, for editors.

Used in [Comment Body](/components/discussion/internal#body) and [Infobox](/infobox#collapsable).

    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.

Does not collapse because the height is not exceed by more than the default threshold of 50px:
