00:00.517 --> 00:02.231
It is time

00:02.350 --> 00:03.417
to defend democracy

00:03.417 --> 00:04.568
against barbarism.

00:08.239 --> 00:09.600
I alone can fix it.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.119
That's how dictators get started.

00:11.453 --> 00:12.808
In Hungary and Russia

00:12.808 --> 00:15.647
the media have been under totalitarian control for years.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.685
Open societies cannot exist without journalism.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.440
A shock and awe series of reports: 

00:21.440 --> 00:24.799
the NSA’s “Collect it All” agenda.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.559
This is the truth, this is what’s happening. 

00:27.799 --> 00:29.239
Why are you so scared of

00:29.240 --> 00:30.559
diversity in the news?

00:30.854 --> 00:31.724
Free speech

00:31.832 --> 00:32.864
against a

00:32.908 --> 00:34.042
dictatorship of fear.

00:35.599 --> 00:36.880
Alternative facts.

00:36.919 --> 00:37.880
We all know, 

00:37.880 --> 00:39.439
these are just speculations.

00:39.479 --> 00:40.599
Fast, loud and

00:40.600 --> 00:42.000
easily digestible.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.680
Whether a story

00:43.680 --> 00:44.520
is true or not

00:44.520 --> 00:45.720
is completely irrelevant

00:45.720 --> 00:47.000
in this attention economy.

00:47.161 --> 00:48.552
Journalism is more than just a business

00:48.552 --> 00:49.743
for a corporation.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.880
It feels like journalism

00:51.880 --> 00:53.119
but it’s advertising.

00:53.639 --> 00:54.720
The average human

00:54.720 --> 00:56.200
can no longer tell the difference 

00:56.200 --> 00:59.479
between the news and an ad.

00:59.799 --> 01:02.013
[off] Who exactly owns your newspaper?

01:02.200 --> 01:04.680
A journalist, editor, publisher

01:04.680 --> 01:06.124
and also politician.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.160
This is all interwoven

01:08.160 --> 01:09.919
beyond recognition.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.639
The newspaper industry today

01:11.640 --> 01:12.599
is in big trouble!

01:12.950 --> 01:13.726
We need

01:13.769 --> 01:14.539
reasonable information

01:14.674 --> 01:16.128
to make informed decisions.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.052
“Swiss Weekly ‘L’Hebdo’ Closing Down”

01:19.100 --> 01:20.381
“Tagi and SoZ Merge Economy Sections”

01:20.381 --> 01:21.639
“Cost Savings at Tamedia”

01:21.639 --> 01:23.720
[off] They say cost pressure is compromising quality…

01:23.760 --> 01:24.959
Swiss publishers

01:24.960 --> 01:26.760
are making digital money

01:26.760 --> 01:29.400
with e-commerce platforms.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.680
It is interesting that we’re doing really well.

01:33.146 --> 01:35.259
Our media system is broken

01:36.988 --> 01:40.189
Let’s build something new collectively.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.857
A new foundation

01:48.857 --> 01:49.733
for independent

01:49.733 --> 01:50.579
journalism.

01:50.579 --> 01:52.280
Ad-free.

01:56.858 --> 01:58.671
Journalism needs passion,

01:58.671 --> 02:01.124
skill and sincerity.

02:12.197 --> 02:14.935
And an attentive, curious

02:14.935 --> 02:16.692
fearless public.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.150
You!

02:19.150 --> 02:19.854
And you!
