# Republik Frontend

The front-end of [republik.ch](https://www.republik.ch/en).

## Usage

### Quick start

Bootstrap your .env file:

```

#### Authentication environment variables

Check the readme inside the root-folder of the mono-repo, on how to setup the env-variables for the authentication to work correctly.

EMAIL_IR=ir@example.com
EMAIL_PAYMENT=payment@example.com
```

### Analytics

You can enable tracking by setting a [Plausible Domain](https://plausible.io/docs/add-website#enter-the-domain-name-of-the-website-you-want-to-track)

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=republik.ch

### GraphQL code generation

When working in the Next.js app-dir located in `src/app`, the type for the queries written in `src/app/*` are automatically generated.

#### Using gql-codegen

When writting a GraphQL query in a `.ts|.tsx`-file, you have to use the `gql`-function that has to be imported from the codegen folders located at `src/app/graphql/<republik-api|cms>/gql`.
When writting the queries in `.gql` or `.graphql` files, the generated query-object, that can be used inside the apollo-client operations are named as follows `<Query-Name-in-pascal-case>Document` and can be imported from `@app/graphql/<republik-api|cms>/gql/graphql`.
The generated types can also be imported from the same path. The typed Query/Mutation result follows the naming pattern `<Query-Name-in-pascal-case><Query|Mutation|Fragment>`. In addition all TS-types for all the types defined by the schema can also be imported from that same path.

Depending on the component you write, you might want it to make use of the Query types or the schema-types.
In general, reusable components should use the generic schema-types.

#### Example

<b>Query - src/app/graphl/cms/FAQQuery.graphql</b>

```graphql
query FAQ {
  faq {
    title
    introduction {
      value
    }
    entries {
      answer {
        value
      }
      question(markdown: false)
      category
    }
  }
}
```

<b>Usage in src/app/faq/page.tsx</b>

```tsx
import { FaqDocument } from '@app/graphql/cms/__generated__/gql/graphql' // <-- generated by gql-codegen

export default async function FAQPage() {
  const client = await getCMSClient()
  const res = await client.query({ query: FaqDocument }) // how to use it in a server-component
  …
}
```

<b>Usage in src/app/faq/components/faq-list.tsx</b>

```tsx
import {
  FaqEntryRecord,
  FaqQuery // <-- FaqQuery is the typed query
} from '@app/graphql/cms/__generated__/gql/graphql'

type FAQListProps = {
  entries: FaqQuery['faq']['entries']
  title: FaqQuery['faq']['title']
  introduction: FaqQuery['faq']['introduction']
}

export default function FAQList({
  entries,
  title,
  introduction,
}: FAQListProps) {
  …
```
