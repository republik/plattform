# Republik Plattform

The platform that powers republik.ch. A tailored solution for a membership based online magazine.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following apps and packages:

### Apps

- `www`: providing the public frontend
- `publikator`: providing publication management interface
- `admin`: providing the customer management interface
- `api`: providing the graphql api
- `assets`: fetching, compressing and resizing assets

The frontends are Next.js apps, the backends use Express.js.

### Packages

- `styleguide`: a React component library shared by all frontends and used by the `api` to render newsletters
- `backend-modules/*`: packages used by the `api` and `assets` server
- `mdast/*`: packages used to work with mdast (previously in it's own [monorepo](https://github.com/orbiting/mdast))
- `eslint-config-*`: multiple eslint configurations which are used accross our apps
- `nextjs-apollo-client`: a reusable Nextjs / Apollo Client setup
- `tsconfig`: a package to store shared typescript configurations
- `icons`: A package to make SVG-files available as react.js components to be used across our frontends.

All packages and apps support [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and plain ECMAScript.

### Licenses

The logo and fonts are the property of their owners (logo—Project R, GT America—GrilliType and Rubis—Nootype), and may not be reproduced without permission.

The `www`, `publikator` app and `styleguide` are BSD-3-Clause licensed. The `api`, `assets` app and all `backend-modules` are AGPL-3.0 licensed. See respective license files in subfolders.

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

To get started you'll need:

- yarn v1.22
- Node.js v20
- Docker or native postgresql@14, elasticsearch@6 and redis

<details><summary>Setup with Docker</summary>
<p>

The included [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) starts all external-services. Currently that's: postgresql, redis, elasticsearch (and kibana).

The data is persisted in `./docker-data/`.

```
docker-compose up [-d]
```

##### Postgresql in docker

We recommend you install the postgresql client tools on your machine to interact with the database. The tests scripts also depend on the clients being installed.

```
# linux
sudo apt install postgresql-client-12
```

When postgresql is running in docker, client tools like `psql` or `createdb`/`dropdb` don't automatically connect to it. They try to access postgresql via a local socket, when instead you want them to connect via network to localhost. To make your life easier, you can add the following environment variables to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` so the client tools connect to localhost per default.

```
export PGHOST=127.0.0.1
export PGUSER=postgres
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Native Setup with Homebrew</summary>
<p>

```bash
brew install postgresql@12 elasticsearch@6 redis nvm
nvm install 14
nvm alias default 14
npm install -g yarn@1.22
brew services start postgresql@12
brew services start elasticsearch@6
brew services start redis
```

#### Docker Kibana accessing native Elasticsearch

```bash
docker run -p 5601:5601 -e ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://host.docker.internal:9200 docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana-oss:6.7.0
```

Note:

- Elasticsearch and Kibana versions must match, ckeck ES version at `http://localhost:9200/`
- `ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS` must be accessible [within docker](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-65-get-your-docker-hosts-ip-address-from-in-a-container).

</p>
</details>

### Env

All apps and the styleguide provide an `.env.example`, the provided default values should be enough to get started:

```bash
cp apps/www/.env.example apps/www/.env
cp apps/publikator/.env.example apps/publikator/.env
cp apps/admin/.env.example apps/admin/.env

cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/assets/.env.example apps/assets/.env
```

<details><summary>Migrating from Individual Repos</summary>
<p>

You may copyover your environment from the individual repos with one manual edit:

```bash
cp ../republik-frontend/.env apps/www/.env
cp ../publikator-frontend/.env apps/publikator/.env
cp ../republik-admin-frontend/.env apps/admin/.env

cp ../styleguide/.env packages/styleguide/.env

cp ../backends/.env apps/api/.env
echo "PORT=5010" >> apps/api/.env

cp ../backends/servers/assets/.env apps/assets/.env
```

</p>
</details>
For more about the available env variables see the individual readme of the apps.

### Setup authentication environment

#### Authentication cookie

The `COOKIE_NAME` env-variable can be defined in `apps/api` and `apps/www`. It's crucial that the value defined in the apps/www file matches the one of the API that you're developing against.
If these two env-variables don't match, www will be stuck in a redirection loop when trying to open the URL `/`.

In addition to the cookie name, there the following env-variables must be set to allow for token based authentication.
The env-variables `JWT_COOKIE_NAME` and `JWT_ISSUER` are present in both the api and www env-files and must be identical.
Additionally a private-key must be provided to the api with the`JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` env-variable and a public-key must be provided to www with the `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` env-variable.
There is a script under `scripts/generate-keypair.sh` that can generate keys in the right format to be directly passed into the corresponding env-files.

### Database Setup

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev:setup
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Please be patient on boot. It might take a minute for everything to compile and a few nodemon restarts before everything runs smoothly.

### Only run certain apps while developing

If you don't want all apps to run when using the `dev` script, you can use the `filter` flag.
(see the [Turborepo documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference#--filter))
For example if you only want to run the republik frontend run `yarn dev --filter=@orbiting/www-app`.

In most cases you have certain dependencies that should be run as well, for example the styleguide if you're developing in the frontend. In that case simply append `...` directly after the filter, to ensure that the additionally to the filtered app, all dependencies are executed as well. (For example in www run: `yarn dev --filter=@orbiting/www-app...`)

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

You can use `yarn commit` to generate a message via an interactive prompt.

**Types**

Always changelog relevant: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`
Others: `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`

Scope is optional.

> The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

> The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.

### Yaproxy

Don't care about developing the backend? Just want to test something against our production backend? We have yet another proxy for that:

```
# terminal 1
yarn yaproxy
# terminal 2
yarn dev:www
```

(Obvious )Warning: whatever you do here is for realz, if you login to your account and change things they are changed on republik.ch!

### Development in a secure context

Install the `ngrok` cli: `brew install --cask ngrok`

Login to ngrok with `ngrok authtoken <token>` (You can find your token at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth)

After adding the authtoken, you must now add the following tunnels to your ngrok configuration file:
(Default config path is `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml`)
```yaml
tunnels:
  republik-frontend:
    proto: http
    addr: 3010
    hostname: republik.eu.ngrok.io
  republik-backend:
    proto: http
    addr: 5010
    hostname: api.republik.eu.ngrok.io
```

Now you must update the following environment variables:

#### Frontend Environment Variables
```
API_URL=https://api.republik.eu.ngrok.io/graphql
API_WS_URL=wss://api.republik.eu.ngrok.io/graphql
```

#### Backend Environment Variables
```
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://republik.eu.ngrok.io # optional
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.republik.eu.ngrok.io
CORS_ALLOWLIST_URL=http://localhost:3003,http://localhost:3005,http://localhost:3006,http://localhost:3010,http://localhost:3000,https://republik.eu.ngrok.io
```

Start your frontend and api using:

```bash
yarn dev --filter=@orbiting/www-app... --filter=@orbiting/api-app...
```


Now run `yarn ngrok:start` in a new terminal inside the workspace-root.

Your local development servers are now relayed to the following ngrok tunnels.

| local-address | ngrok-address                    |
| :------------ |:---------------------------------|
| http://localhost:3010 | https://republik.eu.ngrok.io     |
| http://localhost:5010 | https://api.republik.eu.ngrok.io |

With this you're now able to test payment-options (such as Apple Pay) that are only available in a secure context.

## Deployment

The environment variable `SERVER` is used to determine which app to build and run on deploy. If `SERVER` is missing the api app is run.

A `heroku-prebuild` script runs `scripts/prune.sh` which runs `turbo prune` with the correct scope and moved the pruned apps and packages to the root directory.

A `heroku-postbuild` script is used to add a `Procfile` for running the scheduler on heroku for the `api` app.
